father mapple rose and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense star board gangway there side away to larboard larboard gangway to starboard midships midships there was a low rumbling of heavy seaboots among the benches and a still slighter shuffling of womens shoes and all was quiet again and every eye on the preacher he paused a little then kneeling in the pulpits bows folded his large brown hands across his chest uplifted his closed eyes and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea this ended in prolonged solemn tones like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy the ribs and terrors in the whale arched over me a dismal gloom while all gods sunlit waves rolled by and lift me deepening down to doom i saw the opening maw of hell with endless pains and sorrows there which none but they that feel can tell oh i was plunging to despair in black distress i called my god when i could scarce believe him mine he bowed his ear to my complaints no more the whale did me confine with speed he flew to my relief as on a radiant dolphin borne awful yet bright as lightning shone the face of my deliverer god my song for ever shall record that terrible that joyful hour i give the glory to my god his all the mercy and the power nearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above the howling of the storm a brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the bible and at last folding his hand down upon the proper page said beloved shipmates clinch the last verse of the first chapter of jonah and god had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah shipmates this book containing only four chapters four yarns is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures yet what depths of the soul jonahs deep sealine sound what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet what a noble thing is that canticle in the fishs belly how billowlike and boisterously grand we feel the floods surging over us we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters seaweed and all the slime of the sea is about us but what is this lesson that the book of jonah teaches shipmates it is a twostranded lesson a lesson to us all as sinful men and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living god as sinful men it is a lesson to us all because it is a story of the sin hardheartedness suddenly awakened fears the swift punishment repentance prayers and finally the deliverance and joy of jonah as with all sinners among men the sin of this son of amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of god never mind now what that command was or how conveyed which he found a hard command but all the things that god would have us do are hard for us to do remember that and hence he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade and if we obey god we must disobey ourselves and it is in this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obeying god consists with this sin of disobedience in him jonah still further flouts at god by seeking to flee from him he thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where god does not reign but only the captains of this earth he skulks about the wharves of joppa and seeks a ship thats bound for tarshish there lurks perhaps a hitherto unheeded meaning here by all accounts tarshish could have been no other city than the modern cadiz thats the opinion of learned men and where is cadiz shipmates cadiz is in spain as far by water from joppa as jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days when the atlantic was an almost unknown sea because joppa the modern jaffa shipmates is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean the syrian and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that just outside the straits of gibraltar see ye not then shipmates that jonah sought to flee worldwide from god miserable man oh most contemptible and worthy of all scorn with slouched hat and guilty eye skulking from his god prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas so disordered selfcondemning in his look that had there been policemen in those days jonah on the mere suspicion of something wrong had been arrested ere he touched a deck how plainly hes a fugitive no baggage not a hatbox valise or carpetbag no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux at last after much dodging search he finds the tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo and as he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods to mark the strangers evil eye jonah sees this but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence in vain essays his wretched smile strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent in their gamesome but still serious way one whispers to the other jack hes robbed a widow or joe do you mark him hes a bigamist or harry lad i guess hes the adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah or belike one of the missing murderers from sodom another runs to read the bill thats stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored offering five hundred gold coins for the apprenhension of a parricide and containing a description of his person he reads and looks from jonah to the bill while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round jonah prepared to lay their hands upon him frightened jonah trembles and summoning all his boldness to his face only looks so much the more a coward he will not confess himself suspected but that itself is strong suspicion so he makes the best of it and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised they let him pass and he descends into the cabin whos there cries the captain at his busy desk hurriedly making out his papers for the customs whos there oh how that harmless question mangles jonah for the instant he almost turns to flee again but he rallies i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon sail ye sir thus far the busy captain had not looked up to jonah though the man now stands before him but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing glance we sail with the next coming tide at last he slowly answered still intently eyeing him no sooner sir soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger ha jonah thats another stab but he swiftly calls away the captain from that scent ill sail with ye he says the passage money how much is that ill pay now for it is particularly written shipmates as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history that he paid the fare thereof ere the craft did sail and taken with the context this is full of meaning now jonahs captain shipmates was one whose discernment detects crime in any but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless in this world shipmates sin that pays its way can travel freely and without a passport whereas virtue if a pauper is stopped at all frontiers so jonahs captain prepares to test the length of jonahs purse ere he judge him openly he charges him thrice the usual sum and its assented to then the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold yet when jonah fairly takes out his purse prudent suspicions still molest the captain he rings every coin to find a counterfeit not a forger any way he mutters and jonah is put down for his passage point out my stateroom sir says jonah now im travelweary i need sleep thou lookest like it says the captain theres thy room jonah enters and would lock the door but the lock contains no key hearing him foolishly fumbling there the captain laughs lowly to himself and mutters something about the doors of convicts cells being never allowed to be locked within all dressed and dusty as he is jonah throws himself into his berth and finds the little stateroom ceiling almost resting on his forehead the air is close and jonah gasps then in that contracted hole sunk too beneath the ships waterline jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels wards screwed at its axis against the side a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in jonahs room and the ship heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received the lamp flame and all though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room though in truth infallibly straight itself it but made obvious the false lying levels among which it hung the lamp alarms and frightens jonah as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance but that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him the floor the ceiling and the side are all awry oh so my conscience hangs in me he groans straight upwards so it burns but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed still reeling but with conscience yet pricking him as the plungings of the roman racehorse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels a deep stupor steals over him as over the man who bleeds to death for conscience is the wound and theres naught to staunch it so after sore wrestling in his berth jonahs prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep and now the time of tide has come the ship casts off her cables and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish all careening glides to sea that ship my friends was the first of recorded smugglers the contraband was jonah but the sea rebels he will not bare the wicked burden a dreadful storm comes on the ship is like to break but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her when boxes bales and jars are clattering overboard when the wind is shrieking and the men are yelling and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over jonahs head in all this raging tumult jonah sleeps his hideous sleep he sees no black sky and raging sea feels not the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him aye shipmates jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship a berth in the cabin as i have taken it and was fast asleep but the frightened master comes to him and shrieks in his dead ear what meanest thou o sleeper arise startled from his lethargy by that direful cry jonah staggers to his feet and stumbling to the deck grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea but at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks wave after wave thus leaps into the ship and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat and ever as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead aghast jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul in all his cringing attitudes the godfugitive is now too plainly known the sailors mark him more and more certain grow their suspicions of him and at last fully to test the truth by referring the whole matter to high heaven they alloutward to casting lots to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them the lot is jonahs that discovered then how furiously they mob him with their questions what is thine occupation whence comest thou thy country what people but mark now my shipmates the behavior of poor jonah the eager mariners but ask him who he is and where from whereas they not only receive an answer to those questions but likewise another answer to a question not put by them but the unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hard hand of god that is upon him i am a hebrew he cries and then i fear the lord the god of heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land fear him o jonah aye well mightest thou fear the lord god then straightway he now goes on to make a full confession whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled but still are pitiful for when jonah not yet supplicating god for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts when wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea for he knew that for his sake this great tempest was upon them they mercifully turn from him and seek by other means to save the ship but all in vain the indignant gale howls louder then with one hand raised invokingly to god with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of jonah and now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east and the sea is as jonah carries down the gale with him leaving smooth water behind he goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him and the whale shootsto all his ivory teeth like so many white bolts upon his prison then jonah prayed unto the lord out of the fishs belly but observe his prayer and learn a weighty lesson for sinful as he is jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance he feels that his dreadful punishment is just he leaves all his deliverance to god contenting himself with this that spite of all his pains and pangs he will still look towards his holy temple and here shipmates is true and faithful repentance not clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment and how pleasing to god was this conduct in jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale shipmates i do not place jonah before you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as a model for repentance sin not but if you do take heed to repent of it like jonah while he was speaking these words the howling of the shrieking slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher who when describing jonahs seastorm seemed tossed by a storm himself his deep chest heaved as with a groundswell his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them there now came a lull in his look as he silently turned over the leaves of the book once more and at last standing motionless with closed eyes for the moment seemed communing with god and himself but again he leaned over towards the people and bowing his head lowly with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility he spake these words shipmates god has laid but one hand upon you both his hands press upon me i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that jonah teaches to all sinners and therefore to ye and still more to me for i am a greater sinner than ye and now how gladly would i come down from this masthead and sit on the hatches there where you sit and listen as you listen while some one of you reads me that other and more awful lesson which jonah teaches to me as a pilot of the living god how being an anointed pilotprophet or speaker of true things and bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked nineveh jonah appalled at the hostility he should raise fled from his mission and sought to escape his duty and his god by taking ship at joppa but god is everywhere tarshish he never reached as we have seen god came upon him in the whale and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom and with swift slantings tore him along into the midst of the seas where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down and the weeds were wrapped about his head and all the watery world of woe bowled over him yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet out of the belly of hell when the whale grounded upon the oceans utmost bones even then god heard the engulphed repenting prophet when he cried then god spake unto the fish and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all the delights of air and earth and vomited out jonah upon the dry land when the word of the lord came a second time and jonah bruised and beaten his ears like two seashells still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean jonah did the almightys bidding and what was that shipmates to preach the truth to the face of falsehood that was it this shipmates this is that other lesson and woe to that pilot of the living god who slights it woe to him whom this world charms from gospel duty woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when god has brewed them into a gale woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness woe to him who in this world courts not dishonor woe to him who would not be true even though to be false were salvation yea woe to him who as the great pilot paul has it while preaching to others is himself a castaway he drooped and fell away from himself for a moment then lifting his face to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm but oh shipmates on the starboard hand of every woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight than the bottom of the woe is deep is not the maintruck higher than the kelson is low delight is to him a far far upward and inward delight who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth ever stands forth his own inexorable self delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him delight is to him who gives no quarter in the truth and kills burns and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of senators and judges delight topgallant delight is to him who acknowledges no law or lord but the lord his god and is only a patriot to heaven delight is to him whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure keel of the ages and eternal delight and deliciousness will be his who coming to lay him down can say with his final breath o father chiefly known to me by thy rod mortal or immortal here i die i have striven to be thine more than to be this worlds or mine own yet this is nothing i leave eternity to thee for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his god he said no more but slowly waving a benediction covered his face with his hands and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed and he was left alone in the place returning to the spouterinn from the chapel i found queequeg there quite alone he having left the chapel before the benediction some time he was sitting on a bench before the fire with his feet on the stove hearth and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his peering hard into its face and with a jackknife gently whittling away at its nose meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way but being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon going to the table took up a large book there and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth page as i fancied stopping for a moment looking vacantly around him and giving utterance to a longdrawn gurgling whistle of astonishment he would then begin again at the next fifty seeming to commence at number one each time as though he could not count more than fifty and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited with much interest i sat watching him savage though he was and hideously marred about the face at least to my taste his countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable you cannot hide the soul through all his unearthly tattooings i thought i saw the traces of a simple honest heart and in his large deep eyes fiery black and bold there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils and besides all this there was a certain lofty bearing about the pagan which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim he looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor whether it was too that his head being shaved his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief and looked more expansive than it otherwise would this i will not venture to decide but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one it may seem ridiculous but it reminded me of general washingtons head as seen in the popular busts of him it had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows which were likewise very projecting like two long promontories thickly wooded on top queequeg was george washington cannibalistically developed whilst i was thus closely scanning him halfpretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement he never heeded my presence never troubled himself with so much as a single glance but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous and especially considering the affectionate arm i had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning i thought this indifference of his very strange but savages are strange beings at times you do not know exactly how to take them at first they are overawing their calm selfcollectedness of simplicity seems as socratic wisdom i had noticed also that queequeg never consorted at all or but very little with the other seamen in the inn he made no advances whatever appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances all this struck me as mighty singular yet upon second thoughts there was something almost sublime in it here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home by the way of cape horn that is which was the only way he could get there thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet jupiter and yet he seemed entirely at his ease preserving the utmost serenity content with his own companionship always equal to himself surely this was a touch of fine philosophy though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that but perhaps to be true philosophers we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving so soon as i hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher i conclude that like the dyspeptic old woman he must have broken his digester as i sat there in that now lonely room the fire burning low in that mild stage when after its first intensity has warmed the air it then only glows to be looked at the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements and peering in upon us silent solitary twain the storm booming without in solemn swells i began to be sensible of strange feelings i felt a melting in me no more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world this soothing savage had redeemed it there he sat his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits he was a very sight of sights to see yet i began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him and those same things that would have repelled most others they were the very magnets that thus drew me ill try a pagan friend thought i since christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy i drew my bench near him and made some friendly signs and hints doing my best to talk with him meanwhile at first he little noticed these advances but presently upon my referring to his last nights hospitalities he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows i told him yes whereat i thought he looked pleased perhaps a little complimented we then turned over the book together and i endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it thus i soon engaged his interest and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town soon i proposed a social smoke and producing his pouch and tomahawk he quietly offered me a puff and then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his and keeping it regularly passing between us if there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the pagans breast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out and left us cronies he seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as i to him and when our smoke was over he pressed his forehead against mine clasped me round the waist and said that henceforth we were married meaning in his countrys phrase that we were bosom friends he would gladly die for me if need should be in a countryman this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature a thing to be much distrusted but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply after supper and another social chat and smoke we went to our room together he made me a present of his embalmed head took out his enormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out some thirty dollars in silver then spreading them on the table and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions pushed one of them towards me and said it was mine i was going to remonstrate but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers pockets i let them stay he then went about his evening prayers took out his idol and removed the paper firebrand by certain signs and symptoms i thought he seemed anxious for me to join him but well knowing what was to follow i deliberated a moment whether in case he invited me i would comply or otherwise i was a good christian born and bred in the bosom of the infallible presbyterian church how then could i unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood but what is worship thought i do you suppose now ishmael that the magnanimous god of heaven and earth pagans and all included can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood impossible but what is worship to do the will of god that is worship and what is the will of god to do to my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to me that is the will of god now queequeg is my fellow man and what do i wish that this queequeg would do to me why unite with me in my particular presbyterian form of worship consequently i must then unite with him in his ergo i must turn idolator so i kindled the shavings helped prop up the innocent little idol offered him burnt biscuit with queequeg salamed before him twice or thrice kissed his nose and that done we undressed and went to bed at peace with our own consciences and all the world but we did not go to sleep without some little chat how it is i know not but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends man and wife they say there open the very bottom of their souls to each other and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning thus then in our hearts honeymoon lay i and queequeg a cosy loving pair as we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship queequeg carrying his harpoon captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft unless they previously produced their papers what do you mean by that captain peleg said i now jumping on the bulwarks and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf i mean he replied he must show his papers yes said captain bildad in his hollow voice sticking his head from behind pelegs out of the wigwam he must show that hes converted son of darkness he added turning to queequeg art thou at present in communion with any christian church why said i hes a member of the first congregational church here be it said that many tattooed savages sailing in nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches first congregational church cried bildad what that worships in deacon deuteronomy colemans meetinghouse and so saying taking out his spectacles he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief and putting them on very carefully came out of the wigwam and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks took a good long look at queequeg how long hath he been a member he then said turning to me not very long i rather guess young man no said peleg and he hasnt been baptized right either or it would have washed some of that devils blue off his face do tell now cried bildad is this philistine a regular member of deacon deuteronomys meeting i never saw him going there and i pass it every lords day i dont know anything about deacon deuteronomy or his meeting said i all i know is that queequeg here is a born member of the first congregational church he is a deacon himself queequeg is young man said bildad sternly thou art skylarking with me explain thyself thou young hittite what church dost thee mean answer me finding myself thus hard pushed i replied i mean sir the same ancient catholic church to which you and i and captain peleg there and queequeg here and all of us and every mothers son and soul of us belong the great and everlasting first congregation of this whole worshipping world we all belong to that only some of us cherish some crotchets no ways touching the grand belief in that we all join hands splice thou meanst splice hands cried peleg drawing nearer young man youd better ship for a missionary instead of a foremast hand i never heard a better sermon deacon deuteronomy why father mapple himself couldnt beat it and hes reckoned something come aboard come aboard never mind about the papers i say tell quohog there whats that you call him tell quohog to step along by the great anchor what a harpoon hes got there looks like good stuff that and he handles it about right i say quohog or whatever your name is did you ever stand in the head of a whaleboat did you ever strike a fish without saying a word queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped upon the bulwarks from thence into the bows of one of the whaleboats hanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and poising his harpoon cried out in some such way as this capain you see him small drop tar on water dere you see him well spose him one whale eye well den and taking sharp aim at it he darted the iron right over old bildads broad brim clean across the ships decks and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight now said queequeg quietly hauling in the line sposee him whalee eye why dad whale dead quick bildad said peleg his partner who aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon had retreated towards the cabin gangway quick i say you bildad and get the ships papers we must have hedgehog there i mean quohog in one of our boats look ye quohog well give ye the ninetieth lay and thats more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of nantucket so down we went into the cabin and to my great joy queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ships company to which i myself belonged when all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready for signing he turned to me and said i guess quohog there dont know how to write does he i say quohog blast ye dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark but at this question queequeg who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies looked no ways abashed but taking the offered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm so that through captain pelegs obstinate mistake touching his appellative it stood something like this quohog his x mark meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broadskirted drab coat took out a bundle of tracts and selecting one entitled the latter day coming or no time to lose placed it in queequegs hands and then grasping them and the book with both his looked earnestly into his eyes and said son of darkness i must do my duty by thee i am part owner of this ship and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways which i sadly fear i beseech thee remain not for aye a belial bondsman spurn the idol bell and the hideous dragon turn from the wrath to come mind thine eye i say oh goodness gracious steer clear of the fiery pit something of the salt sea yet lingered in old bildads language heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases avast there avast there bildad avast now spoiling our harpooneer peleg pious harpooneers never make good voyagers it takes the shark out of em no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish there was young nat swaine once the bravest boatheader out of all nantucket and the vineyard he joined the meeting and never came to good he got so frightened about his plaguy soul that he shrinked and sheered away from whales for fear of afterclaps in case he got stove and went to davy jones peleg peleg said bildad lifting his eyes and hands thou thyself as i myself hast seen many a perilous time thou knowest peleg what it is to have the fear of death how then canst thou prate in this ungodly guise thou beliest thine own heart peleg tell me when this same pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on japan that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab didst thou not think of death and the judgment then hear him hear him now cried peleg marching across the cabin and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets hear him all of ye think of that when every moment we thought the ship would sink death and the judgment then what with all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side and every sea breaking over us fore and aft think of death and the judgment then no no time to think about death then life was what captain ahab and i was thinking of and how to save all hands how to rig jurymasts how to get into the nearest port that was what i was thinking of bildad said no more but buttoning up his coat stalked on deck where we followed him there he stood very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a topsail in the waist now and then he stooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine which otherwise might have been wasted
